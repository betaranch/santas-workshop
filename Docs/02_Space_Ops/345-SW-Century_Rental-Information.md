The property is "built out 100%" to be retail or office. The upstairs is approx 1072 sqft and has the restrooms, three divided offices and a large shop, storage area with vaulted ceilings. There was once a beer bar on the main floor with six taps, so the infrastructure is ready for beer or coffee service as an adjunct to retail.

The property is multi zoned but was built prior to ADA rules. It's ok, but if a building permit is needed for a change of use the ADA upgrades would probably be required.
