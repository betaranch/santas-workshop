## Appendix: Project Management Tools Setup (As of Sep 24, 2025)

This section documents the initial setup of our core collaboration tools‚ÄîNotion (for dynamic tasking and ideation) and Google Drive (for static asset storage)‚Äîto support the Elf Speakeasy pop-up. These align with our categories (e.g., Permits & Legal, Space & Ops) for seamless tracking. Links and access are shared in the main Notion dashboard; update here as we iterate.

### Notion Hub Configuration
We've established a central Notion workspace as the "command center," with a master **Task Database** (DB) for all actionable items. This uses one-to-many relationships for structure, avoiding silos while enabling custom views (e.g., kanban by Project, calendar by Due Date).

- **Master Task DB Properties**:
  - **Name** (Title): Task description.
  - **Project** (Select): Primary category (one-to-many; options: Permits & Legal, Space & Ops, Theme Design & Story, Marketing & Sales, Team, Budget & Finance, Vendors & Suppliers, Evaluation & Scaling).
  - **Priority** (Select): Low/Med/High/Critical‚Äîfor sorting/rollups.
  - **Tags** (Multi-Select): Cross-cutting flags (e.g., Urgent üö®, Vendor üõí, Creative üé®, Budget üí∞, Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è, Milestone üèÜ, Team üë•, Review üîç, This Week üìÖ, NYE üéâ)‚Äîintentional overlap with Project/Priority for flexible filtering.
  - **Assignee** (Person): Team member.
  - **Status** (Select): To Do / In Progress / Done.
  - **Due Date** (Date): With reminders.
  - **Files** (Files & Media): Attachments/links to Drive.

- **Key Views & Pages**:
  - **All Tasks Board**: Grouped by Project, filtered by Tags (e.g., "Urgent + This Week").
  - **Project Pages**: One per category (e.g., Permits & Legal page embeds a filtered DB view + resources like vendor contacts).
  - **Dashboard**: Overview with rollups (e.g., tasks per Project, budget variance formula).
  - **Integrations**: Embed Figma prototypes (moodboards, floor plans) and Airtable (proforma calculator, sales tracker).

- **Usage Guidelines**: Tag tasks on creation; weekly syncs filter by "This Week" + High Priority. Formulas auto-tag (e.g., Urgent if Due <3 days).

### Google Drive Folder Structure
A shared root folder mirrors Notion's categories for file storage‚Äîfocused on docs, quotes, and visuals (no tasks here; link via Notion's Files property). Permissions: Full edit for leads on their folders; view-only for vendors.

- **Root Folder**: "Elf_Speakeasy_Project_Hub" (shared with team; version history enabled).
- **Top-Level Folders** (8 core + utils):
  - **01_Permits_Legal**: Apps (TCO/OLCC forms), emails, insurance PDFs.
  - **02_Space_Ops**: Floor plans, schedules, vendor quotes (e.g., porta trailer).
  - **03_Theme_Design_Story**: Moodboards, effects specs, menu assets.
  - **04_Marketing_Sales**: Graphics, campaigns, sales CSVs.
  - **05_Team**: Onboarding guides, meeting notes.
  - **06_Budget_Finance**: Invoices, proformas, receipts.
  - **07_Vendors_Suppliers**: Contracts, inventory lists.
  - **08_Evaluation_Scaling**: Surveys, debriefs.
  - **00_Archive**: Old/completed files.
  - **Utils**: Templates (e.g., LOI draft), backups.

- **Naming Convention**: "Category_Subtopic_Date.ext" (e.g., "Permits_TCO_App_20250924.pdf").
- **Integrations**: Notion tasks link directly to files; monthly archive sweep.

[Link to Google Drive Root](https://drive.google.com/your-folder-link) ‚Äì Set notifications for changes; upload initial checklists today.

This setup ensures 100% traceability‚Äîe.g., a "Vendor Quote" task in Notion pulls the PDF from Drive. Next: Populate with Sep 24 wins (e.g., permit emails). Update this appendix post-setup.
