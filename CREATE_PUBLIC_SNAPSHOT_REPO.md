# Create Public Snapshot Repository - Quick Fix

## The Problem
Your main repo is private, so raw URLs don't work without authentication.

## The Solution: Separate Public Repo (5 minutes)

### 1. Create New Public Repository
Go to: https://github.com/new
- Name: `santas-workshop-snapshot`
- Select **Public** âœ…
- Create repository

### 2. Update Your Workflow

Edit `.github/workflows/simple-snapshot.yml` and add this after the snapshot generation:

```yaml
    - name: Push to public repo
      run: |
        # Clone the public repo
        git clone https://${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}@github.com/betaranch/santas-workshop-snapshot.git public-repo

        # Copy snapshot
        cp LATEST_SNAPSHOT.md public-repo/

        # Push to public repo
        cd public-repo
        git config user.email "action@github.com"
        git config user.name "GitHub Action"
        git add LATEST_SNAPSHOT.md
        git commit -m "ðŸ“¸ Update snapshot - $(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')" || echo "No changes"
        git push
```

### 3. Your New Public URL
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/betaranch/santas-workshop-snapshot/main/LATEST_SNAPSHOT.md
```

This URL will work for everyone!

## Option 2: Use GitHub Gist (Easiest)

### 1. Create a Gist
Go to: https://gist.github.com
- Filename: `project_snapshot.md`
- Make it **Public**
- Create gist
- Copy the Gist ID from URL

### 2. Update Workflow to Update Gist
```yaml
    - name: Update Gist
      run: |
        curl -X PATCH \
          -H "Authorization: token ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" \
          -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
          https://api.github.com/gists/YOUR_GIST_ID \
          -d "{\"files\":{\"project_snapshot.md\":{\"content\":$(cat LATEST_SNAPSHOT.md | jq -Rs .)}}}"
```

## Option 3: Use Pastebin-like Service

Use a free service that accepts API uploads:
- paste.rs
- hastebin
- dpaste

These don't require authentication and provide public URLs.

## Option 4: Make Main Repo Public

If there's nothing sensitive:
1. Go to: https://github.com/betaranch/santas-workshop/settings
2. Scroll to "Danger Zone"
3. Click "Change visibility"
4. Make public

But this exposes your entire codebase.

## Recommended: Option 1

Create the public snapshot repo - it's the cleanest solution and keeps your code private while making the snapshot public.
