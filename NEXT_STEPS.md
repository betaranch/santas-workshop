# Next Steps - Your Action Plan

## What We've Built
✅ **Snapshot Generator** - Creates comprehensive markdown of entire project
✅ **AI Prompts** - Role-specific questions instead of prescriptive analysis
✅ **Web Service** - Local server for testing
✅ **GitHub Actions** - Cloud deployment ready
✅ **Documentation** - Complete setup guides

## Immediate Actions (Today - 30 minutes)

### 1. Test Locally First (5 minutes)
```bash
# Test the snapshot generator
python scripts/compile_project_snapshot.py --no-pull

# Check the output
cat snapshots/latest_snapshot.md
```

### 2. Review the Snapshot Content (10 minutes)
- Open the generated file
- Verify it has all your project data
- Check the AI prompts match your needs
- Each team member can use different perspectives

### 3. Try with AI (5 minutes)
- Copy the entire snapshot
- Paste into Claude or ChatGPT
- Test with role-specific prompts:
  - Design: "What themed elements would enhance immersion?"
  - Logistics: "What operational bottlenecks might occur?"
  - Marketing: "What partnership opportunities exist?"

### 4. Decide on Deployment (10 minutes)
Based on your team's needs, choose:

**Option A: GitHub (Recommended)**
- ✅ Free forever
- ✅ Version control included
- ✅ Creates releases for each snapshot
- ✅ Works for distributed team
- ⏱️ 30 minutes to set up

**Option B: Local Network**
- ✅ Immediate setup
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ❌ Only works in same location
- ⏱️ 5 minutes to set up

## GitHub Setup Steps (If Chosen)

### Phase 1: Repository Setup (10 minutes)
1. Create GitHub account (if needed)
2. Create new private repository
3. Push your code:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with snapshot generator"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/santas-workshop.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Phase 2: Configuration (10 minutes)
1. Add NOTION_API secret to GitHub
2. Create Personal Access Token
3. Test manual workflow run
4. Verify snapshot appears in Releases

### Phase 3: Notion Button (5 minutes)
1. Create button in Notion
2. Add webhook with GitHub URL
3. Add authorization header with token
4. Test button - verify snapshot generates

### Phase 4: Team Access (5 minutes)
1. Add team members to GitHub repo
2. Share Notion page with button
3. Share download links
4. Test with one team member

## How Your Team Will Use It

### Daily Workflow
1. **Team member** needs strategic input
2. **Clicks button** in Notion (any team member)
3. **Waits 2-3 minutes** for generation
4. **Downloads from GitHub** releases page
5. **Pastes into AI** with their role-specific questions
6. **Gets targeted insights** for their area

### Different Perspectives
- **Designer**: Focus on creative and immersion questions
- **Operations**: Focus on logistics and dependencies
- **Marketing**: Focus on revenue and partnerships
- **Each gets different insights** from same data

## Success Metrics

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ Button generates snapshot in < 3 minutes
- ✅ All team members can access snapshots
- ✅ AI provides useful, role-specific insights
- ✅ Team uses it weekly for decisions
- ✅ Insights get documented back in Notion

## Today's Priority Order

1. **Test locally** - Verify it works (5 min)
2. **Review output** - Ensure quality (10 min)
3. **Try with AI** - Validate usefulness (5 min)

If successful:
4. **Create GitHub repo** (10 min)
5. **Push code** (5 min)
6. **Configure GitHub** (10 min)
7. **Set up Notion button** (5 min)
8. **Test with team** (10 min)

Total time: ~1 hour for complete setup

## Questions to Answer Before Setup

1. **Who needs access?** (3 team members)
2. **How often will you generate?** (Weekly? Before big decisions?)
3. **Where to store snapshots?** (GitHub Releases recommended)
4. **Who manages the system?** (One person or shared?)

## If You Hit Issues

Common problems and solutions:

**"I don't want to use GitHub"**
- Use local web service for now
- Consider Vercel later for cloud without GitHub

**"Snapshot is too long"**
- Edit `compile_project_snapshot.py` to reduce content
- Focus on high-priority sections only

**"Team can't access GitHub"**
- Make repository public (if not sensitive)
- Or use local network solution

**"Button doesn't work"**
- Test with local web service first
- Verify webhook URL and token
- Check GitHub Actions logs

## Your Immediate Next Step

**Right now, run this:**
```bash
python scripts/compile_project_snapshot.py --no-pull
```

Then open the file and verify it has what you need. Everything else can wait until you confirm the content is valuable.

*Start with local testing. Deploy to cloud only after you validate the value. The important thing is to start using AI analysis today!*
