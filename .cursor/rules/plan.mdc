# Creative Experience Planning Guidelines

## Experience Design
- **Story-first approach**: Every element serves the immersive narrative
- **Guest journey mapping**: Arrival → Immersion → Peak → Farewell
- **Sensory design**: Sight, sound, scent, touch, taste elements
- **Emotional arcs**: Joy, wonder, connection, lasting memories

## Theme Development (3 Zones)
- **Fireside Mountain Hearth**: Cozy lodge atmosphere
- **Alpine Artisan Hideaway**: Craftsmanship and authenticity
- **Timberline Twilight Lounge**: Elevated, exclusive experience

## Budget Allocation
- **Experience impact first**: Prioritize magical elements over cost
- **Revenue design**: Build upsell opportunities into experiences
- **Fixed costs (53.5K)**: Foundation investment
- **Variable costs**: Allocate by guest satisfaction potential

## Timeline Strategy
- **Experience-driven scheduling**: Optimize for guest flow
- **Progressive reveals**: Build anticipation throughout event
- **Peak timing**: Align high-impact moments strategically
- **Graceful conclusions**: Magical send-offs, not abrupt endings

## Risk Management
- **Weather**: Indoor retreat contingencies for Oregon winter
- **Crowd control**: Exclusive experience flow management
- **Technical issues**: Analog magic fallback plans
- **Staff shortages**: Cross-trained storytelling coverage

## Success Focus
- Guest satisfaction and word-of-mouth
- Social media sharing and engagement
- Return visitor intentions
- Staff pride in magical creation
