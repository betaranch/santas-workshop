# Project Structure & Navigation

## Core Organization
- `Docs/`: Project documentation and planning materials
- `scripts/`: Light Python automation (Notion API only)
- Root: High-level coordination files

## Tool Integration
- **Notion**: Primary collaboration hub for tasks and ideation
- **Figma**: Visual design, floor plans, mood boards
- **Airtable**: Operations, CRM, inventory tracking
- **Google Drive**: Contracts, detailed plans, vendor docs

## File Conventions
- Category_Subtopic_Date.ext format
- Descriptive, searchable naming
- Date-stamped for version tracking

## AI Navigation
- Prioritize creative work over technical implementation
- Reference appropriate tools for different tasks
- Distinguish planning docs (Docs/) from automation (scripts/)
